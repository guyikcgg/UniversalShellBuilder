# UniversalShellBuilder
A library for building your own shell in any microcontroller.

Motivation
----------
It is very common wanting to send some real-time commands to a our microcontroller when developing a project. Maybe we just want to veryfy that a task is being done, or we want to request some direct actions.

I have had to perform this task a couple of times, for different projects on different microcontrollers. For this reason, I am writing this library, which should meet the following requirements:
 1. Reliable.
 2. Compatible.
 3. Tiny-size, huge performance.
 4. Easy to use (little code needed).
 5. Versatile (to be used in every project requiring a shell).

This library is to be written in pure C programming language, to maximize compatibility.

Compatibility
-------------
This library will be tested on Arduino boards, PIC microcontrollers from Microchip and XMC microcontrollers from Infineon.
